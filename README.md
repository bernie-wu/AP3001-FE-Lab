# AP3001-FE-Lab

## Usage

- Either download the project zip-file from Github or clone using git
- Download the latest Julia release for your system: http://julialang.org
- Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the project
- launch julia
- Issue the following command from the julia command line:

```
include("tsunami.jl")
```

The first time this will take a long time since the correct packages need to be downloaded and compiled. Subsequent executions should finish much faster.

You can edit the source file in any editor. The recommended environment is vscode with the Julia extension installed.
